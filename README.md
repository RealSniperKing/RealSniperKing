### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **SniperKing**, [computer graphics artist and developer](http://lucchambaud.free.fr/PLC/index.php).
I started to learn programming on Unity 3D, to build interactive virtual tour applications.

Today I develop a lot of  plugins and scripts Python. I use this language to automate tasks or to create new tools in [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com), or [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) softwares.

Recently, I'm starting classes to raise my skills and obtain diploma "Python software developer"!
